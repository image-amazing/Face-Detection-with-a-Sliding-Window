README:

Variables are saved under the variables subfolder to save on computational time. If HogCellSize is changed, delete the files inside the variables folder and rerun the program.

MULTI-SCALE: Enable MultiScale in run_detector.m. You can also set the starting scale level and the the amount the scale decreases by each time.

HARDMINING: Enable hard mining through setting the variable hardMining in proj5.m to 1. When a new HOGCell Size is used, delete the variables saved under variables subfolder in the code folder and rerun.
